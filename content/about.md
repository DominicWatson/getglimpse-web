## What is wrong with the "GIMP" name?
If English is not your first language, then you may not have realised that the word "gimp" is problematic. In some countries it is considered a slur against disabled people and a playground insult thrown at unpopular children. It can also be linked to certain "after dark" activities performed by consenting adults.

You may think that this is "political correctness gone mad" and that those who have been complaining about it for more than a decade are "over-sensitive", but this choice does have real-life consequences. Many of us have our own free software advocacy stories about the GNU Image Manipulation Program not being taken seriously in professional settings, or an educational institution that felt unable to provide or recommend the program to their students for legal or moral reasons.

We believe free software should be accessible to everyone, and in this case a re-brand is both a desirable and very straightforward fix that could attract a whole new generation of contributors and users.

## Why are you forking?
In recent versions of the upstream software you may have noticed that the window titles have switched to "GNU Image Manipulation Program" and the documentation [suggests expanding the acronym](https://www.gimp.org/docs/userfaq.html#i-dont-like-the-name-gimp-will-you-change-it) as a work-around for the bad name. However, we do not think that adequately addresses the issue because the website domain, documentation and wider community still refers to it as "the Gimp" just as they have done for the last two decades.

Feature requests have been raised about the problem multiple times on the project's communication channels over the last 13 years, but each time they are ignored, dismissed and/or the discussions get spammed by those with strong political views.

It is unfortunate that we have to fork the whole project to change the name, but we feel that discussions about the issue are at an impasse and that this is the most positive way forward.

## Will you be contributing your changes back?
Absolutely! We intend to be good free software citizens, and as soon as we have made changes that the upstream project wants to incorporate we will assist them whenever we can.

While we might not agree on some things, it is clear to us that an adversarial attitude will not help either project. If we work together then the whole free software community can benefit from a fork that attracts new contributors, breathes new life into an ageing codebase and shares free software with a whole new audience.

## This code project is very big! Won't it take you a long time to completely rebrand?
The first release should appear within weeks because it will just have a cosmetic rebrand, and possibly some fixes or additions to the build system so it works with our choice of modern tools and technologies.

The major refactoring and de-cluttering work will happen in a future release that "hard forks" from version 2.10. At that stage we will be able to consider more radical ideas, new features and fixes that address long-standing complaints.

Also a lot of people have expressed an interest in contributing to this fork, which is definitely speeding up progress. The first few days were particularly frantic as we gathered ideas and feedback from the community and started rolling out their choice of project infrastructure.
