To test things locally, run the following after cloning:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoThemes themes
hugo
```

This outputs the results to a `public/` folder, and this is what will be published.

**Please Note**: The server checks this git repository for changes every 15 minutes. Test locally, *then* publish.
